# Active Context: Ecoinvent Dataset Scraper

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on creating a robust web scraper application that can extract specific data from ecoinvent.org dataset pages. The implementation uses Playwright for browser automation and includes features like rate limiting, error handling, and structured data output.

## Recent Changes
- Created the initial project structure with modular components
- Implemented the core scraping functionality with Playwright
- Added robust error handling with retry mechanism
- Implemented progress tracking with visual feedback
- Created flexible data extraction methods to handle variations in page structure

## Next Steps
1. **Testing**: Test the scraper against actual ecoinvent dataset pages to verify proper extraction
2. **Selector Refinement**: Fine-tune the HTML selectors based on actual page structure
3. **Performance Optimization**: If needed, optimize memory usage and request patterns
4. **Documentation Updates**: Update documentation based on testing results
5. **Feature Enhancements**: Consider adding features like:
   - Filtering capabilities for extracted data
   - Export to multiple formats (CSV, Excel)
   - Command-line arguments for easier configuration

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Technical Decisions
1. **Multiple Selector Strategies**:
   - Current approach uses multiple selector strategies (CSS selectors, XPath, DOM traversal) for each data point
   - This provides redundancy when the primary selector method fails
   - Decision to maintain for improved resilience against page structure changes

2. **Configurable Rate Limiting**:
   - Current implementation uses a fixed delay between requests
   - Considering implementing adaptive rate limiting based on server responses
   - Trade-off: Complexity vs. scraping efficiency

3. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Current implementation retries failed requests with a fixed delay
   - Considering implementing exponential backoff for more intelligent retrying
   - Decision: Maintain simple retry for now, revisit if needed

### Important Patterns and Preferences
1. **Parsing Strategy Preference**:
   - Use CSS selectors as the first attempt method
   - Fall back to page.evaluate() for more complex DOM traversal when needed
   - Include multiple selector attempts to handle page variations

2. **File Naming Convention**:
   - Output files named by dataset ID: `dataset_[id].json`
   - Maintain consistency for easy identification and processing

3. **Code Organization**:
   - Maintain clear separation between configuration, parsing, and logging
   - Keep extraction logic isolated in the parser module for easier updates

## Learnings and Project Insights
1. **Web Scraping Challenges**:
   - Ecoinvent pages may have dynamic content requiring proper waiting strategies
   - Multiple approaches for finding elements provide better resilience
   - Rate limiting is essential to avoid being blocked

2. **Extraction Techniques**:
   - Simple selectors may not be sufficient for all elements
   - Text-based searches within page content can be more reliable for some data points
   - Context-aware extraction (looking for labels then adjacent content) works better than fixed selectors

3. **User Experience Considerations**:
   - Progress feedback is important for lengthy scraping operations
   - Clear error messages help identify issues with specific datasets
   - Statistics at the end provide useful summary of the operation
