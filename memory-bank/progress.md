# Progress: Ecoinvent Dataset Scraper

## What Works
- [x] **Project Structure**: Complete modular architecture with separated concerns
- [x] **Core Scraping Engine**: Implementation of Playwright-based scraper
- [x] **Data Extraction**: Flexible extraction mechanisms for all required data points:
  - [x] Product name
  - [x] Geography
  - [x] Reference Product
  - [x] Unit
  - [x] Documentation
- [x] **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with retry mechanism
- [x] **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar and detailed logging
- [x] **Output Format**: Structured JSON output for extracted data
- [x] **Rate Limiting**: Basic rate limiting to respect the target server
- [x] **Configuration**: Centralized, adjustable configuration

## What's Left to Build
- [ ] **Selector Verification**: Test and refine selectors against actual ecoinvent pages
- [ ] **Command-line Arguments**: Add CLI options for easier configuration
- [ ] **Additional Output Formats**: Support for CSV, Excel export
- [ ] **Batch Processing**: Capability to split processing into batches
- [ ] **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Adjust request rate based on server responses
- [ ] **Data Validation**: Validate extracted data for completeness
- [ ] **Filtering Capabilities**: Allow filtering of datasets by various criteria
- [ ] **Resumable Scraping**: Ability to resume from where a previous run stopped

## Current Status
The project is in an initial implementation stage. The core architecture and functionality are complete, but testing and refinement based on actual page structure is needed. The application is functional and can be run to scrape data, but selectors may need adjustments based on actual ecoinvent page structure.

### Implementation Status
- **Core Framework**: 100% complete
- **Data Extraction**: 90% complete (selectors may need refinement)
- **Error Handling**: 100% complete
- **User Interface**: 90% complete (CLI arguments pending)
- **Documentation**: 95% complete

## Known Issues
1. **Selector Uncertainty**: The exact selectors for data extraction need verification against actual ecoinvent pages
2. **Basic Rate Limiting**: Current implementation uses fixed delays rather than adaptive rate limiting
3. **Single Output Format**: Currently only outputs JSON format

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Design (Current)
- **Parser Approach**: Multiple selector strategies for resilience
- **Browser Automation**: Headless browser approach with Playwright
- **Error Handling**: Simple retry mechanism with fixed delays
- **Project Structure**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns

### Considerations for Future Versions
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Consider parallel processing for faster scraping
  - Implement batch processing for large dataset ranges
  - Add memory usage monitoring for large scraping operations

- **User Experience Improvements**:
  - Add command-line arguments for easier configuration
  - Support for multiple output formats (CSV, Excel)
  - Add filtering capabilities for more targeted data extraction

- **Resilience Enhancements**:
  - Implement exponential backoff for retries
  - Add resumable scraping capability
  - Implement adaptive rate limiting

### Technical Debt Notes
- **Parser Complexity**: The multiple selector approach adds complexity but is necessary for resilience
- **Configuration Hardcoding**: Some parameters could be moved to command-line arguments
- **Error Types**: More specific error types could improve error handling precision
