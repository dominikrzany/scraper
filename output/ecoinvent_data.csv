1,"electricity production, nuclear, boiling water reactor",Finland (FI),"electricity, high voltage",kWh,"DocumentationGeneral comment This dataset represents the production of high voltage electricity at a grid-connected nuclear boiling water reactor (BWR) in Finland in 2012.
It is a copy of the dataset ""electricity production, nuclear, boiling water reactor, CH, 1995-2002"", i.e. of a dataset with data for a Swiss nuclear BWR. The basic source for all exchanges is therefore the ecoinvent report ""Kernenergie"" (see Modelling and Administrative). Data of this CH dataset are scaled with a factor derived from the comparison of the efficiencies of Swiss BWR and those valid for this dataset in order to account for a higher or lower fuel input for the production of 1 kWh, respectively.
The average burnup 48.6 MWd/kg heavy metal of finally discharged fuel elements from the 2000/2002 fuel cycles has been assumed representative for the lifetime of the modeled plant (the burnup has increased from the initial about 33 MWd/kg heavy metal and may increase to 55 MWd/kg heavy metal in the future). The average burnup corresponds to an average enrichment of 3.8% U235 for fresh uranium fuel elements. For the calculation of the total net electricity delivered in 40 years lifetime, the sum of the actual production till 2002 and the prospective (9000 GWh/a) till end of life using  is considered; this gives 3.46E11 kWh; the inverse gives the utilisation factor for the infrastructure. Full detailed information on material requirements during operation for 1991/1992 are available. The diesel requirements for the yearly test of diesel emergency generators are accounted for. Radioactive emission species to air and water are weighted averages of the emissions of the nuclear power plants Leibstadt and MÃ¼hleberg (CH) from 1995 to 2002. Alpha aerosols emission to air have been described with ""aerosols, unspecified"". Considered radioactive waste streams are: spent fuel to reprocessing (40%) and conditioning (60%); operational low active waste for conditioning in the intermediate repository; and, contaminated waste from dismantling.

2,silicon tetrachloride production,Global (GLO),carbon monoxide,kg,"DocumentationGeneral comment Production of silicon tetrachloride production by chlorination method using silica sand as raw material.Technology Silicon tetrachloride production by chlorination method using silica sand (SiO2) as raw material.
The amount of silicon dioxide (SiO2), carbon and chlorine (Cl2) entering the process is calculated via stoichiometric equation. The efficiency of the reaction is assumed to be 95%, thus the amount of all the substances entering the process is multiplied by (1/0.95). In the case of sodium dioxide the unreacted amount is assumed to be released as solids, inorganic as a part of wastewater. The unreacted amount of carbon is assumed to be converted within the boundaries of the activity into carbon dioxide (either during air emission treatment - flaring or during wastewater treatment). 0.2% of the imput amount of chlorine is assumed to be emitted into the air. Remaining amount of unreacted chlorine is released as chloride as a part of wastewater. It is assumed that internal wastewater treatment is a part of the activity. Its efficiency is assumed to be 90%, thus only 10% of the unreacted amount of substances which are present in the wastewater are lately released into the environment.

3,stretch blow moulding,Rest-of-World (RoW),stretch blow moulding,kg,"DocumentationGeneral comment 1 kg of this process equals 0.978 kg of strech blow moulded plastics.
[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3.

The converted amount of plastics is NOT included into the dataset.Product information This is delivering the service of 'stretch blow moulding'. Stretch blow molding is a special form of blow molding. The process exploits the fact that high degrees of orientation can be introduced in plastics by drawing at temperatures near the glass transition temperature or crystalline melting point. Mechanical properties are considerably improved in this way. In this process, the preform is drawn not only in the circumferential direction (as with extrusion blow molding) but also in the machine direction. The longitudinal drawing is brought about mechanically by using a ram. Because of the relatively low temperature at which this process is carried out, high deformation forces are required (air pressure up to 2 MPa).  In the service of strech blow moulding, 1 kg of this process corresponds to 0.978 kg of strech blow moulded plastic.The converted amount of plastics is not included into the dataset. Thus, this service should be used along with 1 kg of thermoplastic materials, like polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PETP).Geography comment information from different European and Swiss converting companiesTime period Comment time to which data referSampling procedure company dataExtrapolations no extrapolation This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.
