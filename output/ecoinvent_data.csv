1,"electricity production, nuclear, boiling water reactor",Finland (FI),"electricity, high voltage",kWh,"DocumentationGeneral comment This dataset represents the production of high voltage electricity at a grid-connected nuclear boiling water reactor (BWR) in Finland in 2012.
It is a copy of the dataset ""electricity production, nuclear, boiling water reactor, CH, 1995-2002"", i.e. of a dataset with data for a Swiss nuclear BWR. The basic source for all exchanges is therefore the ecoinvent report ""Kernenergie"" (see Modelling and Administrative). Data of this CH dataset are scaled with a factor derived from the comparison of the efficiencies of Swiss BWR and those valid for this dataset in order to account for a higher or lower fuel input for the production of 1 kWh, respectively.
The average burnup 48.6 MWd/kg heavy metal of finally discharged fuel elements from the 2000/2002 fuel cycles has been assumed representative for the lifetime of the modeled plant (the burnup has increased from the initial about 33 MWd/kg heavy metal and may increase to 55 MWd/kg heavy metal in the future). The average burnup corresponds to an average enrichment of 3.8% U235 for fresh uranium fuel elements. For the calculation of the total net electricity delivered in 40 years lifetime, the sum of the actual production till 2002 and the prospective (9000 GWh/a) till end of life using  is considered; this gives 3.46E11 kWh; the inverse gives the utilisation factor for the infrastructure. Full detailed information on material requirements during operation for 1991/1992 are available. The diesel requirements for the yearly test of diesel emergency generators are accounted for. Radioactive emission species to air and water are weighted averages of the emissions of the nuclear power plants Leibstadt and Mühleberg (CH) from 1995 to 2002. Alpha aerosols emission to air have been described with ""aerosols, unspecified"". Considered radioactive waste streams are: spent fuel to reprocessing (40%) and conditioning (60%); operational low active waste for conditioning in the intermediate repository; and, contaminated waste from dismantling.

2,silicon tetrachloride production,Global (GLO),carbon monoxide,kg,"DocumentationGeneral comment Production of silicon tetrachloride production by chlorination method using silica sand as raw material.Technology Silicon tetrachloride production by chlorination method using silica sand (SiO2) as raw material.
The amount of silicon dioxide (SiO2), carbon and chlorine (Cl2) entering the process is calculated via stoichiometric equation. The efficiency of the reaction is assumed to be 95%, thus the amount of all the substances entering the process is multiplied by (1/0.95). In the case of sodium dioxide the unreacted amount is assumed to be released as solids, inorganic as a part of wastewater. The unreacted amount of carbon is assumed to be converted within the boundaries of the activity into carbon dioxide (either during air emission treatment - flaring or during wastewater treatment). 0.2% of the imput amount of chlorine is assumed to be emitted into the air. Remaining amount of unreacted chlorine is released as chloride as a part of wastewater. It is assumed that internal wastewater treatment is a part of the activity. Its efficiency is assumed to be 90%, thus only 10% of the unreacted amount of substances which are present in the wastewater are lately released into the environment.

The converted amount of plastics is NOT included into the dataset.Product information This is delivering the service of 'stretch blow moulding'. Stretch blow molding is a special form of blow molding. The process exploits the fact that high degrees of orientation can be introduced in plastics by drawing at temperatures near the glass transition temperature or crystalline melting point. Mechanical properties are considerably improved in this way. In this process, the preform is drawn not only in the circumferential direction (as with extrusion blow molding) but also in the machine direction. The longitudinal drawing is brought about mechanically by using a ram. Because of the relatively low temperature at which this process is carried out, high deformation forces are required (air pressure up to 2 MPa).  In the service of strech blow moulding, 1 kg of this process corresponds to 0.978 kg of strech blow moulded plastic.The converted amount of plastics is not included into the dataset. Thus, this service should be used along with 1 kg of thermoplastic materials, like polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PETP).Geography comment information from different European and Swiss converting companiesTime period Comment time to which data referSampling procedure company dataExtrapolations no extrapolation This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.

15,benzyl alcohol production,Rest-of-World (RoW),benzyl alcohol,kg,"DocumentationGeneral comment This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of benzyl alcohol via the hydrolysis of benzyl chloride. Benzyl alcohol is a colorless liquid with a faint aromatic odor and a mildly irritating effect on the mucous membranes. By virtue of its good solvent properties, benzyl alcohol is an important solvent for surface-coating materials and resins. It dissolves cellulose esters and ethers, alkyd resins, acrylic resins, and fats; it is also used as an ingredient in the inks for ball-point pens. It is added in small amounts to surface-coating materials to improve their flow and gloss. In the textile industry, it is used as an auxiliary in the dyeing of wool, polyamides, and polyesters. Because it has only a relatively faint odor, it is used as a solvent and diluting agent in the manufacture of perfumes and flavors. In color photography it is increasingly important as a development accelerator. In pharmacy it is used as a local anesthetic and, because of its microbicidal effect, as an ingredient of ointments and other preparations. Benzyl alcohol is a starting material for the preparation of numerous benzyl esters that are used as
odorants, flavors, stabilizers for volatile perfumes, and plasticizers. Benzyl alcohol is also used in the extractive distillation of m- and p-xylenes and m- and p-cresols.
Two production processes are of substantial industrial importance for benzyl alcohol: the hydrolysis of benzyl chloride and the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde. In this dataset, the production of benzyl alcohol by means of the hydrolysis of benzyl chloride is considered. The data are taken from a database which reports data from several US production plants for the years 1998 to 2004 (Overcash 1998-2004) and are representative for US production. The infrastructure is included with a default value.

Overcash, M., Chemical life cycle database, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695-7905. 1998 - 2004.Technology Benzyl alcohol can be produced in many ways. At present there are only two processes of substantial industrial importance: the hydrolysis of benzyl chloride and the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde. Other processes, like the oxidation of toluene, the hydrogenation of benzoic acid esters, the electrochemical reduction of benzoic acid, the hydrolysis of benzylsulfonic acid, and the decarboxylation of benzyl formate, have no importance in the industrial production of benzyl alcohol. The hydrolysis of benzyl chloride is a reversible reaction which leads to the almost quantitative formation of benzyl alcohol only in the presence of alkaline saponifying agents that combine with the hydrogen chloride as it is formed. It is therefore carried out by heating benzyl chloride with stoichiometric excesses of aqueous solutions of oxides, hydroxides, or carbonates of the alkali or alkaline earth metals.
To 610 parts of boiling 10 % soda solution 126.5 parts of benzyl chloride is added with stirring. The reaction mixture is refluxed and stirred until carbon dioxide no longer escapes; this takes an average of five to six hours. An alkali-resistant steel reactor with brick walls is used. The stirrer and heating coil are made of an alloy with a high nickel content. After the reaction mixture has cooled, the upper layer, consisting of crude benzyl alcohol, is removed. The sodium chloride solution below still contains some soda. Dissolved benzyl alcohol can be obtained from it by adding salt or by extracting with benzene or toluene. The crude benzyl alcohol is carefully fractionated at a reduced pressure in an efficient column. The yield is 85 parts of benzyl alcohol and 10 parts of dibenzyl ether.

See dataset ""wind turbine construction, 2MW, onshore"" for detailed technical information.Included activities starts From operation of the wind power plant to high voltage electricity at the plant. According to (European Communities 2001), electricity produced with wind turbines in a wind power plant is connected to medium voltage or high voltage systems, depending on the size of the windfarm. Normally, each wind turbine contains a transformer from low voltage to medium voltage. The network connection additionally transforms the electricity to high voltage electricity. It is assumed here, that there are no stand-alone grid-connected small wind turbines and that all electricity is connected to the network in form of high voltage electricity.

58,cyanoacetic acid production,Europe (RER),cyanoacetic acid,kg,"DocumentationGeneral comment The process “cyanoacetic acid, at plant, RER” is modelled for the production of cyanoacetic acid from chloroacetic acid in Europe. Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.
Cyanoacetic acid (C3H3NO2; CAS 372-09-8) forms colourless, hygroscopic crystals, that undergo decarboxylation above 160 °C to give acetonitrile. The compound has a dissociation constant of 3.65 × 10–3 in water (25 °C) and dissolves readily in water, but is only moderately soluble in ethanol, and sparingly in benzene. The industrially most important cyanoacetate is ethyl cyanoacetate, followed by the methyl ester. Both esters are colourless liquids, which are miscible with ethanol and diethyl ether but insoluble in water. Cyanoacetic acid and the cyanoacetates are produced by the same route (and often in the same plant) as the malonates by cyanidation of sodium chloroacetate followed by acidification of the sodium cyanoacetate solution. Cyanoacetic acid is isolated by extraction with an organic solvent and evaporation of the solvent, whereas the cyanoacetates are obtained by mineral acid-catalyzed esterification with subsequent azeotropic removal of water. Major byproducts are malonates and succinates. A process variation involves interchange of the cyanidation and esterification steps. In this case, however, the formation of the side product dimethyl or diethyl 2-cyanosuccinate is difficult to suppress. In order to avoid the isolation, most of the cyanoacetic acid outlets are produced directly from solution.
The world's largest cyanoacetate plant was brought on stream in 1987 in Mobile (Alabama) by Hüls. The annual production capacity of this plant was later expanded to 8000 t.
Alternative methods for the preparation of cyanoacetic acid involve the carboxylation of acetonitrile and the oxidation of partially oxidized propionitriles. Other methods for the preparation of cyanoacetates include the cleavage of cyanoacetaldehyde dimethyl acetal, formed by a palladium-catalyzed oxidation of acrylonitrile, the alkoxycarbonylation of chloroacetonitrile and pyrolysis of 3,3′-bisisoxazole in the presence of an alcohol. However, none of these processes have been used industrially.
The most important application of cyanoacetates is in the field of adhesives. Knoevenagel reaction of alkyl cyanoacetates with formaldehyde affords α-cyanoacrylates, which are stable under exclusion of air but polymerize rapidly to polycyanoacrylates after application on a surface even at room temperature. This polymerization is reversible on heating and the monomer can be formed back and subsequently polymerized again by traces of moisture. Esters of higher alcohols, such as 1-butanol, are also employed.
Otherwise, cyanoacetates are used for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, dyes, and UV absorbers. For many applications cyanoacetic acid, cyanoacetates, or cyanoacetamide can be used alternatively. Caffeine (R = CH3) is synthesized from theophylline (R = H), which is accessible in several steps from cyanoacetic acid and 1,3-dimethylurea. The traded cyanoacetic acid is mainly used for the production of the fungicide cymoxanil and the cough remedy dextromethorphan.

61,"electricity production, oil",Sweden (SE),"electricity, high voltage",kWh,"DocumentationGeneral comment This dataset represents the production of high voltage electricity at a grid-connected oil power plant with a capacity of 500 MW on the world in 2012.
Emissions are in general calculated/estimated based on the fuel oil type S, European quality. This dataset has been built on the basis of oil electricity production datasets in version 2 of the ecoinvent database which were elaborated by N. Jungbluth 2007 (see main publication in modelling and administrative). The values and emissions are a weighted average of emissions in all datasets in version 2 (which are considered as the global values) multiplied with an efficiency scaling factor. The datasets in version 2 were valid for the following countries: AT, BE, BR, GR, CN, CS, CZ, DE, DK, ES, FI, FR, GB, GR, HR, HU, IE, IT, JP, MK, NL, NO, PT, PL, SE, SI, SK. Weighting was made with electricity production data in those countries based on IEA/OECD 2010. The weighted averages are taken as global values and then scaled with a factor derived from the comparison of the global average efficiency and the efficiency valid for this dataset in order to account for a higher or lower fuel input for the production of 1 kWh, respectively.   Nothing else than the efficiency has been adjusted in this dataset; besides that no new data collection has taken place

62,"electricity production, hydro, run-of-river",Ireland (IE),"electricity, high voltage",kWh,"DocumentationGeneral comment This dataset represents the production of 1 kWh of electricity in a run-of-river power plant unit in Ireland in 2012. Run-of-river power plants are hydro power plants without reservoirs. Depending on the net head of the power plant, high-pressure, medium-pressure and low-pressure systems can be distinguished. Low-pressure power plants including river power stations and canal power plants are very common; therefore these two types of run-of-river power stations are covered in the dataset. To some extent, high-pressure as well as medium-pressure run-of-river systems can be considered as reservoir power stations, e.g. as unit in plant groups that are dominated by storage power plants, but also include alpine run power stations.
LCI data are based on a representative sample of various types of power plants in Switzerland and Austria is taken into account. The calculations are based on the information and data of the following run-of-river power plants: Rupperswil-Auenstein (Baumann 1949), Wildegg-Brugg (NOK 1956), Birsfelden (Aegerter et al. 1954), Donaukraftwerk Greifenstein (Brux 1983; max. Leistung 237 MW) and Rheinkraftwerk Albbruck-Dogern (Radag 1979) as well as the new construction of the power plant Ruppoldingen. The determined specific data was then related to the entire power plant park of Switzerland with an annual net electricity output of 15484 GWh/a (BEW 2001a). Lifetime is assumed to be 80 years for the structural part (including cement, reinforcing steel, diesel, electricity, transportation and explosives) and 40 years for the rest of materials. The data refers to plant construction of a mix of types of dams built between 1945 and the beginning of the 1980s; therefore they might not be representative for more modern construction, for an individual type and for small-scale and smallest-scale plants.

[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]Technology Run-of-river power plants are hydro power plants without important reservoirs. Depending on the net head of the power plant, high-pressure, medium-pressure and low-pressure systems can be distinguished. Low-pressure power plants including river power stations and canal power plants are very common; therefore these two types of run-of-river power stations are covered in the dataset. To some extent, high-pressure as well as medium-pressure run-of-river systems can be considered as reservoir power stations, e.g. as unit in plant groups that are dominated by storage power plants, but also include alpine run power stations.
The technology used in the dataset has an overall efficiency of 82%, more modern technologies show an overall efficiency of about 88%. The overall efficiency (current: 0,82; modern: 0,88) is composed of the efficiency of the works water channel (current: 1,00; modern: 1,00), the turbine (current: 0,87; modern: 0,91), the generator (current: 0,96; modern: 0,98) and the transformer (current: 0,98; modern: 0,99). For the calculation of the works water channel of run-of-river plants an efficiency of 100% is assumed.
The efficiency losses in turbines depend on the turbine type (Kaplan, Francis, Pelton, etc.), the turbine output and on the ratio between turbined water amount and the rated water amount. In König, examples for curve progressions of the relationship between these variables are shown. For current power plants an efficiency of 87% is assumed, more modern turbines show an efficiency of about 91%.
The efficiency of generators depends on the output, the rotation speed of the generator and the cooling system. For today’s power plants an efficiency of approximately 96% is assumed, modern generators show an efficiency of about 98%. The efficiency of transformers amounts to 98%, respectively 99%.

64,"soda production, solvay process",Rest-of-World (RoW),calcium chloride,kg,"DocumentationGeneral comment This dataset represents the production of soda ash (sodium carbonate, Na2CO3), calcium chloride (CaCl2) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) by means of the Solvay process.
Soda is primarily used in the glass industry as raw material for the decomposition of sand. Another important use of soda is in the chemical industry for the production of chemicals. In the detergent and soap industry, soda ash is used for the manufacture of detergents and for the saponification of grease. Also the paper and cellulose industry uses soda for the digestion, the neutralization, the cleaning and the leaching as well as for the recycling of wastepaper.
Calcium chloride is most widely used for its de-icing and dust control abilities. It is primarily used for the de-icing of roads. For this application, calcium chloride is used in the form of flakes with at least 77 wt% calcium chloride. There are no special requirements on the purity of the product for this application. Other areas of application of calcium chloride include road stabilisation and dust control, industrial processing, oil and gas well fluids, and concrete production.
Sodium bicarbonate is used in a number of industries, it is used in cooking, commonly reffered to as baking soda, as a neutralising agent and in the medical industry.
This dataset is based on literature data, mainly from a German report on the best available techniques (BAT) for soda production. The production of sodium bicarbonate has been introduced in a second step to the dataset. The solvay process can produce a number or by-products, among which sodium bicarbonate. The main production route of sodium bicarbonate is the Solvay process, followed by the other commercially available process, Trona ore mining. The dataset has been adjusted accordingly, knowing that 2 moles of sodium bicarbonate are needed to produce 1 mol of soda, threfore the dataset has been modified based on the Solvay process step: 2NaHCO3 --(heat)--> Na2CO3 + H2O + CO2 (CO2 is recirculated in the process).

Soda ash is manufactured in two grades: ”light ash“ and ”heavy ash“, the difference being the much greater volume occupied by a given mass of light ash. Heavy ash, when transported in bulk, has a pouring density equal to or slightly above that of water, whereas the pouring density of light ash is only half of this value. Heavy ash is clearly the preferred form for economic transportation over long distances. For general chemicals production, light ash is widely used because of its traditionally lower price, its higher rate of dissolution and reaction, and its freedom from calcium ions, which are unacceptable in certain processes, as for example in soap manufacture.Included activities starts The activity starts when the raw materials enter the process.Included activities ends This activity ends with the production of soda, sodium bicarbonate and calcium chloride. The dataset includes the consumption of raw materials, auxiliaries, energy, infrastructure and land use. The system also includes the generation of wastes and emissions into air and water.

65,primary lead production from concentrate,Global (GLO),crust from Parkes process for lead production,kg,"DocumentationGeneral comment The dataset describes the primary production of 1 kg of lead and 0.008 kg of Parkes process crust, in 2005.  The activity is modelled as a combination of the two predominant smelting processes: Sinter oxidation / blast furnace reduction, and direct smelting process.Technology There are two basic pyrometallurgical processes available for the production of lead from lead or mixed lead-zinc-sulphide concentrates: sinter oxidation / blast furnace reduction route or Direct Smelting Reduction Processes. Both processes are followed by a refining step to produce the final product with the required purity, and may also be used for concentrates mixed with secondary raw materials.
SINTER OXIDATION / BLAST FURNACE REDUCTION:
The sinter oxidation / blast furnace reduction involves two steps: 1) A sintering oxidative roast to remove sulphur with production of PbO; and 2) Blast furnace reduction of the sinter product.
The objective of sintering lead concentrates is to remove as much sulphur as possible from the galena and the accompanying iron, zinc, and copper sulphides, while producing lump agglomerate with appropriate properties for subsequent reduction in the blast furnace (a type of a shaft furnace).
As raw material feed, lead concentrates are blended with recycled sinter fines, secondary material and other process materials and pelletised in rotating drums. Pellets are fed onto sinter machine and ignited. The burning pellets are conveyed over a series of wind-boxes through which air is blown. Sulphur is oxidised to sulphur dioxide and the reaction generates enough heat to fuse and agglomerate the pellets.
Sinter is charged to the blast furnace with metallurgical coke. Air and/or oxygen enriched air is injected and reacts with the coke to produce carbon monoxide. This generates sufficient heat to melt the charge. The gangue content of the furnace charge combines with the added fluxes or reagents to form a slag.
For smelting bulk lead-zinc-concentrates and secondary material, frequently the Imperial Smelting Furnace is used. Here, hot sinter and pre-heated coke as well as hot briquettes are charged. Hot air is injected. The reduction of the metal oxides not only produces lead and slag but also zinc, which is volatile at the furnace operating temperature and passes out of the ISF with the furnace off-gases. The gases also contain some cadmium and lead. The furnace gases pass through a splash condenser in which a shower of molten lead quenches them and the metals are absorbed into the liquid lead, the zinc is refined by distillation.
DIRECT SMELTING REDUCTION:
The Direct Smelting Reduction Process does not carry out the sintering stage separately. Lead sulphide concentrates and secondary materials are charged directly to a furnace and are then melted and oxidised. Sulphur dioxide is formed and is collected, cleaned and converted to sulphuric acid. Carbon (coke or gas) and fluxing agents are added to the molten charge and lead oxide is reduced to lead, a slag is formed. Some zinc and cadmium are “fumed” off in the furnace, their oxides are captured in the abatement plant and recovered.
Several processes are used for direct smelting of lead concentrates and some secondary material to produce crude lead and slag. Bath smelting processes are used: the ISA Smelt/Ausmelt furnaces (sometimes in combination with blast furnaces), Kaldo (TBRC) and QSL integrated processes are used in EU and Worldwide. The Kivcet integrated process is also used and is a flash smelting process. The ISA Smelt/Ausmelt furnaces and the QSL take moist, pelletised feed and the Kaldo and Kivcet use dried feed.
REFINING:
Lead bullion may contain varying amounts of copper, silver, bismuth, antimony, arsenic and tin. Lead recovered from secondary sources may contain similar impurities, but generally antimony and calcium dominate. There are two methods of refining crude lead: electrolytic refining and pyrometallurgical refining. Electrolytic refining uses anodes of de-copperised lead bullion and starter cathodes of pure lead. This is a high-cost process and is used infrequently. A pyrometallurgical refinery consists of a series of kettles, which are indirectly heated by oil or gas. Over a series of separation processes impurities and metal values are separated from the lead bouillon.
Overall waste: The production of metals is related to the generation of several by-products, residues and wastes, which are also listed in the European Waste Catalogue (Council Decision 94/3/EEC). The ISF or direct smelting furnaces also are significant sources of solid slag. This slag has been subjected to high temperatures and generally contains low levels of leachable metals, consequently it may be used in construction. Solid residues also arise as the result of the treatment of liquid effluents. The main waste stream is gypsum waste (CaSO4) and metal hydroxides that are produced at the wastewater neutralisation plant.
These wastes are considered to be a cross-media effect of these treatment techniques but many are recycled to pyrometallurgical process to recover the metals. Dust or sludge from the treatment of gases are used as raw materials for the production of other metals such as Ge, Ga, In and As, etc or can be returned to the smelter or into the leach circuit for the recovery of lead and zinc. Hg/Se residues arise at the pre-treatment of mercury or selenium streams from the gas cleaning stage. This solid waste stream amounts to approximately 40 - 120 t/y in a typical plant. Hg and Se can be recovered from these residues depending on the market for these metals.
Overall emissions: The main emissions to air from zinc and lead production are sulphur dioxide, other sulphur compounds and acid mists; nitrogen oxides and other nitrogen compounds, metals and their compounds; dust; VOC and dioxins. Other pollutants are considered to be of negligible importance for the industry, partly because they are not present in the production process and partly because they are immediately neutralised (e.g. chlorine) or occur in very low concentrations. Emissions are to a large extent bound to dust (except cadmium, arsenic and mercury that can be present in the vapour phase).
Metals and their compounds and materials in suspension are the main pollutants emitted to water. The metals concerned are Zn, Cd, Pb, Hg, Se, Cu, Ni, As, Co and Cr. Other significant substances are fluorides, chlorides and sulphates. Wastewater from the gas cleaning of the smelter and fluid-bed roasting stages are the most important sources.

67,"electricity production, hydro, run-of-river","Western Electricity Coordinating Council, US part only (US-WECC)","electricity, high voltage",kWh,"DocumentationGeneral comment This dataset represents the production of 1 kWh of electricity in a run-of-river power plant unit in US - Western Electricity Coordinating Council in 2012. Run-of-river power plants are hydro power plants without reservoirs. Depending on the net head of the power plant, high-pressure, medium-pressure and low-pressure systems can be distinguished. Low-pressure power plants including river power stations and canal power plants are very common; therefore these two types of run-of-river power stations are covered in the dataset. To some extent, high-pressure as well as medium-pressure run-of-river systems can be considered as reservoir power stations, e.g. as unit in plant groups that are dominated by storage power plants, but also include alpine run power stations.
LCI data are based on a representative sample of various types of power plants in Switzerland and Austria is taken into account. The calculations are based on the information and data of the following run-of-river power plants: Rupperswil-Auenstein (Baumann 1949), Wildegg-Brugg (NOK 1956), Birsfelden (Aegerter et al. 1954), Donaukraftwerk Greifenstein (Brux 1983; max. Leistung 237 MW) and Rheinkraftwerk Albbruck-Dogern (Radag 1979) as well as the new construction of the power plant Ruppoldingen. The determined specific data was then related to the entire power plant park of Switzerland with an annual net electricity output of 15484 GWh/a (BEW 2001a). Lifetime is assumed to be 80 years for the structural part (including cement, reinforcing steel, diesel, electricity, transportation and explosives) and 40 years for the rest of materials. The data refers to plant construction of a mix of types of dams built between 1945 and the beginning of the 1980s; therefore they might not be representative for more modern construction, for an individual type and for small-scale and smallest-scale plants.

[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]Technology Run-of-river power plants are hydro power plants without important reservoirs. Depending on the net head of the power plant, high-pressure, medium-pressure and low-pressure systems can be distinguished. Low-pressure power plants including river power stations and canal power plants are very common; therefore these two types of run-of-river power stations are covered in the dataset. To some extent, high-pressure as well as medium-pressure run-of-river systems can be considered as reservoir power stations, e.g. as unit in plant groups that are dominated by storage power plants, but also include alpine run power stations.
The technology used in the dataset has an overall efficiency of 82%, more modern technologies show an overall efficiency of about 88%. The overall efficiency (current: 0,82; modern: 0,88) is composed of the efficiency of the works water channel (current: 1,00; modern: 1,00), the turbine (current: 0,87; modern: 0,91), the generator (current: 0,96; modern: 0,98) and the transformer (current: 0,98; modern: 0,99). For the calculation of the works water channel of run-of-river plants an efficiency of 100% is assumed.
The efficiency losses in turbines depend on the turbine type (Kaplan, Francis, Pelton, etc.), the turbine output and on the ratio between turbined water amount and the rated water amount. In König, examples for curve progressions of the relationship between these variables are shown. For current power plants an efficiency of 87% is assumed, more modern turbines show an efficiency of about 91%.
The efficiency of generators depends on the output, the rotation speed of the generator and the cooling system. For today’s power plants an efficiency of approximately 96% is assumed, modern generators show an efficiency of about 98%. The efficiency of transformers amounts to 98%, respectively 99%.

69,"heat and power co-generation, natural gas, conventional power plant, 100MW electrical",Rest-of-World (RoW),"electricity, high voltage",kWh,"DocumentationGeneral comment This dataset represents the production of high voltage electricity and heat in a conventional steam boiler natural gas power plant with CHP (combined heat and power) on the world in 2012.
For electricity production with natural gas, four different datasets relying to different power plant types exist:

conventional power plant with / without CHP

combined cycle power plant with / without CHP

At the moment, these datasets differ in nothing but the efficiency. High voltage electricity (at the busbar) is the reference product,  whereupon heat is a by-product in CHP plants. Out of all fossile fuels, natural gas holds worldwide the highest share of CHP plants besides peat. Furthermore, natural gas power plants are today often designed with combined cycles.
The approximate share of combined cycle natural gas power plants on the world amounts to ca. {{cc_share}}. {{chp}} combined heat power plants (calculations made with IEA/OECD statistics and own assumptions).
The efficiency calculations are based on IEA/OECD statistics (fuel inputs, electricity produced) and some own calculation assumptions. . Reducing factors such as contaminations of important plant parts, cooling conditions or part load have been taken into account. Even if efficiencies vary with different surrounding temperatures, a medium efficiency is assumed for all countries. Temperature adjustments would be related to high uncertainties.
Water is used for wet cooling and as feed water in the steam circuit. In this dataset, 100% wet cooling and no once-through cooling is assumed.
EMISSIONS:
Different sources served as basis for assumption of average emissions. Where possible, the most recent sources were taken into account, whereas older sources were taken in order to determine the remaining data gaps. The emissions have been fixed for the former UCTE region* and have been overtaken as such for all countries without value adaptation (adaptation of the uncertainty). See ecoinvent report 'Erdgas' given as main source for details (Tab. 11.15). In the following a short overview:

Emissions of NOx, CO, CO2, SO2, particles, N2O and CH4 are mainly taken from CORINAIR 2001, EPA, and a variety of other data sources

NOx emissions are a major challenge in natural gas power plants. With rising temperature, emissions also rise; band widths of NOx emissions in literature are correspondingly large. There are several methods to diminish these emissions.

CO is a result of incomplete burning. For economic and technical reasons, plant combustion is optimized and CO emissions are low.

CO2 and SO2 emissions are dependent on the composition of the used fuel. Due to the low sulfur content of the used natural gas, no desulfurization has to take place.

Organic compound emissions are estimated on the basis of EPA 1998.

Particles are assumed to be smaller than 2.5 micro-m

84,"electricity production, hydro, reservoir, alpine region",Bosnia and Herzegovina (BA),"electricity, high voltage",kWh,"DocumentationGeneral comment This dataset represents the production of high voltage electricity at grid-connected reservoir hydropower plants in Bosnia Herzegovina in 2012. Here, the reservoir hydropower plants are modelled with alpine region plants based on data from Swiss hydropower plants. A representative sample of Swiss dams with a height of more than 30 metres is taken into account for calculating the input. Lifetime is assumed to be 150 years for the structural part and 80 years for the turbines. Net average electrical efficiency, including pipe losses, is  78% (best efficiency can be 84%).Technology Storage power plants have an appendant reservoir. The size of the reservoir can range from daily, monthly to annual storage reservoirs. According to the net head high-pressure, medium-pressure and low-pressure systems can be distinguished. High- and medium-pressure systems are constructed as dams. High-pressure storage power plants with a head of over 50 meters are very common in Switzerland. For this dataset concrete dams (arch dams and gravity dams) with a height of more then 30 meters are taken into account. Also pumped storage power plants are included because in most cases the data is only available for the overall generation system. The same counts for high- and medium-pressure and alpine run-of-river power plants which are also included in the storage power plant dataset. Due to the fact that the efforts for the plant construction are similar to storage power plants and that the estimated production is comparatively low, high- and medium-pressure run-of-river power plants are covered by the reservoir power station dataset.
The technology used in the dataset has an overall efficiency of 82%, more modern technologies show an overall efficiency of about 88%. The overall efficiency is composed of the efficiency of the works water channel, the turbine, the generator and the transformer and are listed below:
Efficiency of power plant               current    modern
Works water channel	        0.95	     0.95
Turbine	                                        0.87	     0.91
Generator	                                        0.96      0.98
Transformer	                        0.98	     0.99
Reservoir power plant total
without works water channel           0.82	     0.88
with works water channel                0.78	     0.84
Pumped storage power plant        0.70	    0.74
The losses along the works water channel are primarily caused by friction and are calculated from the difference between gross and net head. Based on this calculation the efficiency of the works water channel amounts to 95%. The losses depend on the flow rate and have its maximum at full load. The smaller the cross section of adits and pressure pipelines, the higher the flow velocity and thus the friction losses. In older plants according to Bischof (1992) the efficiency of works water channels could be increased generally more than by replacing turbines and generators.
The efficiency losses in turbines depend on the turbine type (Kaplan, Francis, Pelton, etc.), the turbine output and on the ratio between turbined water amount and the rated water amount. In König (1997) examples for curve progressions of the relationship between these variables are shown. For current power plants an efficiency of 87% is assumed, more modern turbines show an efficiency of about 91%.
The efficiency of generators depends on the output, the rotation speed of the generator and the cooling system. Some relevant data can be found in König (1997). For today’s power plants an efficiency of approximately 96% is assumed, modern generators show an efficiency of about 98%. The efficiency of transformers amounts to 98%, respectively 99%.

93,"heat and power co-generation, wood chips, 6667 kW, state-of-the-art 2014",SERC Reliability Corporation (US-SERC),"electricity, high voltage",kWh,"DocumentationGeneral comment This technology currently does not contribute to power generation in this country. However, it is supposed to contribute to expansion/replacement of power generation capacity between today and 2030; therefore, electricity is the reference product. This dataset represents the production of heat and electricity with wood chips in a state-of-the-art (as of 2014) co-generation plant with a capacity of 6667 kW (referring to fuel input) in Switzerland and was used as approximation for this dataset valid for a global average (uncertainties adjusted accordingly). The technology corresponds to a modern unit to be installed in 2014 in Switzerland, which is equipped with an electrostatic precipitator for particulate matter (PM) emission reduction and an SNCR device for reduction of NOx emissions. Electricity is produced with an organic rankine cycle (ORC) steam generator.
Wood chips are burned in a boiler at a temperature of 800-1300 °C under excess air conditions and turned into carbon dioxide and water. Energy is set free in form of heat. Burning takes place with the following steps:

Drying

degradation of the wood into carbon and gases

degradation of the carbon into gases

oxidation of the gases

These phases overlap. The produced heat can be used directly or for steam production in order to generate electricity with a turbine.
Emissions vary with quality of the combustion (temperatur, mixing of the combustion gases and the added fresh air, retention time of gases in the combustor), filter technologies and with the efficiency of the plant. Emission data in this dataset are taken from measurements and literature as well as from communication with experts.
CO2 emissions were calculated out of the carbon content of the wood used as combustible. Carbon emitted in carbon monoxide was subtracted from the result.
Key emissions factors for CO, NOx, CH4, NMVOC and particles were updated according to latest data.
All other emission factors (per MJ fuel input) correspond to the 1000 kW boiler fuelled with wood chips from forest. Other exchanges correspond to the LCI data for the 6400 kW co-generation unit in ecoinvent v2.2.

Comments on the inventory data of emissions:

for the assessment of main characteristics (sulphur and ash content of coal, efficiency of the plant) and CO2 a bottom-up approach has been used. It consists in the collection of information about single plants.

Halogene emissions have been estimated on the basis of the content of the species in the country-specific coal input mix, assuming average retention rates.

For CO and particle emissions average values for the former UCTE are included (Union for the Coordination of the Transmission of Electricity, since 2009 replaced by ENTSO-E European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity).

The country specific emissions of N2O depend on the share of DeNOx.  - Emissions of trace elements were calculated by means of a formula (CORINAIR) using the ash content in the country-specific coal input mix and average transfer coefficients for coal power plants, taking into account the share of DeSOx installed.

Emission of uranium and thorium radioactive isotopes were assumed proportional to the corresponding element emitted with particles; the other non-gaseous radioactive isotopes of the uranium and thorium decay chain were assumed proportional to the emitted U-238 or Th-232.

The emission of gaseous radon and K-40 are taken from the literature.

99,charcoal production,Global (GLO),charcoal,kg,"DocumentationGeneral comment This dataset represents the production of one kg of charcoal from hardwood.
The dataset considers the production of charcoal from wood as a pre-product for technical processes. The carbon content of the charcoal ranges between 78 and 90-wt% and is assumed 80%. The heating value of charcoal ranges between 29 and 33MJ/kg. The hardwood used in the charcoal production is from forest plantations with full CO2 uptake assumed.
The dataset is based on literature data for European production, which is assumed to represent the average global production. Most of the global production, however, takes place in South America and Asia; for inventories of charcoal from these two regions it is suggested to do a sensitivity analysis and calculate a part of the CO2 emissions as fossil emissions.
Particle emission figures are assumed equal to data from carbon black production. A large uncertainty is related to the CO2 uptake and release in the life cycle which is not directly quantified here. Charcoal from developing countries comes from native forest. Furthernore, due to transportation to Europe this charcoal use cannot be considered CO2 neutral.Technology The efficiency of charcoal production shows large variations from 9 to 35% depending on the state of technology applied (Risollo-Calle et al., 1996).
The technology assumed is pyrolysis of wood in a small scale production plant / a kiln. No waste gas or effluent treatment is considered. A production of 0.3 kg charcoal/kg wood is assumed. 2.93 kg of CO2 are formed during the combustion of 1 kg charcoal. Here it is assumed that the by-products of the pyrolysis (methanol, acetic acid, etc.) can be used (0.23 kg/kg wood), but all environmental impacts of the production are allocated to the main product charcoa (Briane et al., 1985)l.
Production of 1 kg charcoal, incl. wood drying process, uses 2.5 MJ heat, 0.075 kWh electricity and 50 l cooling water. It is assumed that wood boilers provide the remaining heat of 0.9 MJ/kg charcoal (Brocksiepe, 1997).
Construction work is mainly human labour. Often there are no fixed plants but production sites are located near the forest with no fixed infrastructure parts.

101,p-chlorophenol production,Rest-of-World (RoW),p-chlorophenol,kg,"DocumentationGeneral comment The process “p-chlorophenol, at plant, GLO"" is modelled for the production of p-chlorophenol from phenol. Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.
p-Chlorophenol (C6H5ClO; CAS 106-48-9, 4-chlorophenol) is solid at ambient temperature and has a strong characteristic odour. It is only slightly soluble in water, but highly soluble in alcohols. The mono-, di-, and trichlorophenols which have no chlorine atom in the meta position relative to OH are 2-chlorophenol, 4-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,6-dichlorophenol, and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. The tetrachlorophenols and pentachlorophenol are also included with this type. These compounds are obtained by the direct chlorination of phenol: C6H6O + Cl2 → C6H5ClO + HCl (Ullmanns 2000). The chlorination of melted phenol using chlorine gas yields a mixture of ortho and para monochlorophenols with an o/p ratio of ca. 0.54 (35/65), which is scarcely dependent on temperature. The distribution between the two isomers depends especially on the nature of the chlorination reagent and the characteristics of the reaction medium. The formation of 2-chlorophenol is favored by an aprotic nonpolar solvent medium, such as hexane, carbon tetrachloride, or dichloroethane. The o/p ratio is also higher for reactions with a low concentration of phenol and a high temperature. The chlorination of a 5 % solution of phenol in perchloroethylene at 110 °C in the presence of 0.01 wt % diisopropylamine gives a very high o/p ratio, ca. 15. Chlorinations using aqueous sodium hypochlorite] at pH 10, tert-butyl hypochlorite and alkali phenolates dispersed in an anhydrous medium, or chlorine in acetic acid in the presence of acetic anhydride also favor the formation of 2-chlorophenol.
The formation of 4-chlorophenol is favored by chlorination in a polar medium, such as acetonitrile, nitrobenzene, or ether. Substitution in the para position is also strongly favored by the use of sulfuryl chloride as a chlorinating agent  (o/p = 0.35). Certain organic sulfides, e.g., diphenyl sulfide, activate chlorination and favor substitution at the para position. Chlorination using copper(II) chloride in aqueous hydrochloric acid in the presence of oxygen leads to 4-chlorophenol (almost 100 %).
Mono-, di-, and trichlorophenols are made industrially by chlorination of phenol with chlorine gas in a melt in cast-iron reactors. The isomer distribution in the product may be adjusted to market demands by the chlorination level and by recycling various intermediates. The yield, based on chlorine and phenol, is greater than 95 %.
Tetrachlorophenols and pentachlorophenol are produced batchwise in nickel reactors by the chlorination of less halogenated chlorophenols in the presence of aluminum trichloride or iron trichloride.
Chlorophenols are used as agricultural chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biocides, and dyes.
The preparation of agricultural chemicals consumes 80 – 90 % of chlorophenol production. The annual consumption of the herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-4-butyric acid is 30 – 40 kt. Hoelon (Hoechst), Modown (Mobil), Ronstar (Rhône-Poulenc), and TOK E-25 (Rohm and Haas) are among the major herbicides. Curacron (Ciba Geigy) exemplifies the insecticides made from chlorophenols. Among the fungicides are Bayleton (Bayer), MO (Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals), and Procloraz or Sportak (Boots).
Pharmaceuticals derived from chlorophenols include clofibrate, ethyl 2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-methylpropionate (ICI), used in the treatment for high serum cholesterol, and Mervan or Aldofene, an antiinflammatory and analgesic drug (Continental Pharma).
Biocides that are based on chlorophenols include the molluscicide Bayluscide (Bayer) and the bactericide Santophen or Chlorophen (Monsanto). Pentachlorophenol is also used to make wood and cellulose preservatives, esters for the textile and leather industries, paints, varnishes, and organic adhesives.
The sodium salt of pentachlorophenol is an active, water-soluble material. It is used as a preservative for such organic materials as freshly sawn wood (against blue rot), paints, adhesives, textiles, leather, and furs.
Chlorophenols are used in the synthesis of anthraquinone dyes.

The raw materials are mixed with water to a homogeneous paste. Rotating sieving cylinders dip in this fibre cement mush which drain to the inside. Therefore the sieve surface gets covered with a layer of fleece of about 1mm which is transported with a conveyor belt. The produced endless mat is winded up on a format-cylinder until the demanded thickness is reached. With that process the fibres of the neighbour layers are interconnecting. After cutting up the mat cylinder the mat is detached from the format-cylinder and by punching and pressing automatically formed to small format slates, even and corrugated slabs.Included activities starts From the extraction of raw materials.Included activities ends The activity ends with the corrugated slabs produced and the wastes treated. The dataset includes the whole manufacturing process to produce fibre cement products (raw material provision, raw material mixing, forming, post curing process coating process, and storage), transports to plant processes, and infrastructure.

However, it is supposed to contribute to expansion/replacement of power generation capacity between today and 2030; therefore, electricity is the reference product. This dataset represents the production of heat and electricity with wood chips in a state-of-the-art (as of 2014) co-generation plant with a capacity of 6667 kW (referring to fuel input) in Switzerland and was used as approximation for this dataset valid for a global average (uncertainties adjusted accordingly). The technology corresponds to a modern unit to be installed in 2014 in Switzerland, which is equipped with an electrostatic precipitator for particulate matter (PM) emission reduction and an SNCR device for reduction of NOx emissions. Electricity is produced with an organic rankine cycle (ORC) steam generator.
Wood chips are burned in a boiler at a temperature of 800-1300 °C under excess air conditions and turned into carbon dioxide and water. Energy is set free in form of heat. Burning takes place with the following steps:

Drying

degradation of the wood into carbon and gases

degradation of the carbon into gases

oxidation of the gases

These phases overlap. The produced heat can be used directly or for steam production in order to generate electricity with a turbine.
Emissions vary with quality of the combustion (temperatur, mixing of the combustion gases and the added fresh air, retention time of gases in the combustor), filter technologies and with the efficiency of the plant. Emission data in this dataset are taken from measurements and literature as well as from communication with experts.
CO2 emissions were calculated out of the carbon content of the wood used as combustible. Carbon emitted in carbon monoxide was subtracted from the result.
Key emissions factors for CO, NOx, CH4, NMVOC and particles were updated according to latest data.
All other emission factors (per MJ fuel input) correspond to the 1000 kW boiler fuelled with wood chips from forest. Other exchanges correspond to the LCI data for the 6400 kW co-generation unit in ecoinvent v2.2.

134,"sodium tetrafluoroborate production, sodium tetrahydridoborate fluorination",Global (GLO),sodium tetrafluoroborate,kg,"DocumentationGeneral comment This dataset represents the production of diborane by means of the reaction of boron trifluoride with sodium tetrahydridoborate (also known as sodium tetrahydroborate). Sodium tetrafluoroborate is obtained as a co-product. Diborane (B2H6) is a colorless gas at room temperature with a repulsively sweet odor. B2H6 mixes well with air, easily forming explosive mixtures. Diborane will ignite spontaneously in moist air at room temperature.
Diborane serves as a strong but selective reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is an electrophilic reagent and reacts markedly differently from the nucleophilic alkali-metal boron and aluminum hydrides. Hydroboration, the addition of diborane or borane to olefins, has found great significance in preparative chemistry. Hydroboration is applicable to multiple bonds between C–C, C–O, C–N, N–N, N–O. Diborane catalyzed by the presence of an ether adds, in an anti-Markovnikov mode, virtually quantitatively to the carbon – carbon double bond of olefins, forming an alkyl borane.
Other important derivatives of diborane are Lewis base adducts, carbonyl adducts, and oxygen-containing products. Further areas of application for diborane are the doping of semiconductor silicon and germanium. Diborane is readily decomposed at high temperature (600 – 700 °C) to give fine powder, high-purity elemental boron. Copyrolysis of diborane with hydrocarbons yields boron carbide, and with NH3 yields boron nitride. These materials, deposited on metal substrates as thin, hard layers, are used in ceramics, tools, and wear-resistant parts. Boron fibers are formed from the decomposition of diborane on substrates and used for light-weight structural components.
The large cross-sectional area of the 10B isotope for neutron capture makes these compounds especially useful in nuclear applications. Borane is also supplied as stable liquid adducts (CH3 )2S · BH3 (Callery Chemical Co., Aldrich Chemical Co.), and as a 1 M solution in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Aldrich Chemical Co., Ventron Div. of Morton-Thiokol Inc.).
As there was no data available for the fluorination of sodium tetrahydridoborate, this dataset is based on stoechiometric calculations and estimations. The values for the consumption of the raw materials are calculated, and the emissions are estimated. The energy and water consumption are estimated based on data from a large chemical plant (Gendorf 2016).

Gendorf (2016) Umwelterklärung 2015, Werk Gendorf Industriepark, www.gendorf.de.Technology Sodium tetrahydridoborate fluorination is one of the most important processes to produce diborane. The method preferred for the commercial preparation of diborane is the addition of boron trifluoride to a stirred solution of sodium tetrahydridoborate in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme):

Diborane is shipped either as a compressed gas (ambient) or as a liquid (cylinder over packaged with dry ice). It is packaged as a hazardous material regulated by the DOT.

This route involves the following sequence of process steps:
 reaction of ethylene oxide with a significant stoichiometric excess of water at a temperature of 120–250 °C and a pressure above 10–40 bar;
 separation by distillation (and subsequent recycling) of the water from the ethylene glycols mixture;
 separation by distillation of the mono-, di-, tri- and polyethylene glycols, employing progressively higher levels of vacuum.

The technology corresponds to a modern unit to be installed in 2014 in Switzerland, which is equipped with an electrostatic precipitator for particulate matter (PM) emission reduction and an SNCR device for reduction of NOx emissions. It is assumed that the plant is operated mainly producing heat, i.e. following the heat demand. Heat is therefore considered as the main product and therefore the reference product, whereas electricity is a by-product. Electricity is produced with an organic rankine cycle (ORC) steam generator.
Wood chips are burned in a boiler at a temperature of 800-1300 °C under excess air conditions and turned into carbon dioxide and water. Energy is set free in form of heat. Burning takes place with the following steps:

Drying

degradation of the wood into carbon and gases

degradation of the carbon into gases

oxidation of the gases

These phases overlap. The produced heat can be used directly or for steam production in order to generate electricity with a turbine.
Emissions vary with quality of the combustion (temperatur, mixing of the combustion gases and the added fresh air, retention time of gases in the combustor), filter technologies and with the efficiency of the plant. Emission data in this dataset are taken from measurements and literature as well as from communication with experts.
CO2 emissions were calculated out of the carbon content of the wood used as combustible. Carbon emitted in carbon monoxide was subtracted from the result.
Key emissions factors for CO, NOx, CH4, NMVOC and particles were updated according to latest data.
All other emission factors (per MJ fuel input) correspond to the 1000 kW boiler fuelled with wood chips from forest. Other exchanges correspond to the LCI data for the 6400 kW co-generation unit in ecoinvent v2.2.

156,"sulfite pulp production, bleached",Rest-of-World (RoW),"sulfite pulp, bleached",kg,"DocumentationGeneral comment This dataset is a copy of the European dataset (sulfite pulp production, bleached, RER, 2020). It characterises the average production of bleached chemical pulp following the acidic sulfite process in Europe. The dataset aggregates the most common bleaching technologies: Total Chlorine Free (TCF) and Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF). Chemical pulp is produced by chemical pulping of biomass raw materials, most commonly hardwood and softwood,or alsostraw from many cereals, bagasse, reed, or esparto grass, and from other annual non-wood plants.
The sulfite process is based on calcium, magnesium, and sodium or ammonium bisulfide and produces pulp which is virtually pure cellulose. As the process occurs in acidic conditions one of its drawbacks is that some of the cellulose is hydrolysed, making the sulfite pulp fibres not as strong as other pulps, for example, those obtained with the sulphate process (i.e. kraft pulp). Nonetheless, and although globally the sulfate process is used in up to 90% of chemical pulping processes, sulfite pulps are important for specialty papers (e.g. tissue, glassine) and as a sources of cellulose for various applications within or out of the paper industry.
This dataset represents the production of sulfite market pulp, i.e. sulfite pulp sold on the market as opposed to integrated sulfite pulp which is produced at paper mills with integrated pulping facilities. In Europe, 68% of sulfite pulp were produced at integrated mills, 32% were sold on the market. This break down was not available on a global level, therefore it was assumed the European shares apply globally.
The main sources of information for this dataset are a questionnaire completed by a European sulfite pulp producer using a Ca-bisulfite bleaching process and the Finnish EcoData database of KCL following a Mg-sulfite bleaching process (KCL, 2002). Further data sources include a report of the Swedish EPA about the Swedish pulp and paper industry (Naturvardsverket, 2001), a German inventory on graphical paper commissioned by the UBA (Tiedemann et al., 2000) and the European IPPC documentation for the paper and pulp industry, which also contains information on Best Available Techniques (BAT) and the description and quantification of the present situation of the pulp and paper industry (European Commission, 2000).
The European Commission (2000) states that TCF is the primary bleaching process in Europe. For this and copyright reasons of the KCL data, a distribution of 25% ECF and 75% TCF is assumed for the calculation of the average KCL dataset .

161,"mine construction, open cast, hard coal",Global (GLO),"mine infrastructure, open cast, hard coal",unit,"DocumentationGeneral comment This dataset represents the construction of an opencast mine for hard coal mining. Life time is assumed to be the same as for opencast mines for mining lignite. Thus, an average life time of 30 years is considered for machinery.
Data represent first approximations due to the insufficient availability of data. The estimates are based on data about four opencast mines: Oberdorf (Austria), Kans-Achinsk/Ekibastuz (Russia), Rheinbraun AG (Germany) and Rietspruit (South Africa). Hence, only figures per tone hard coal were given in literature and no information about average annual production of hard coal was available. Due to these facts a total production of 100 million tons has been assumed to represent a worldwide average (excluding small mines in China). This estimation includes both opencast and underground mines; therefore the total production shall be seen more as a normalization factor than an actual average value for the production of open pit mines.
Due to the fact that hard coal has to be treated, higher figures for infrastructure are considered. It has to be considered that this dataset is based on few data about opencast mines thus it may not reflect specific mines. Even with a broader database it would not have been possible to calculate assured mean values. This is due to the fact that there are big differences between mines and complete data of several hundred mines would have been required.

164,"heat and power co-generation, wood chips, 6667 kW, state-of-the-art 2014, renewable energy products",Switzerland (CH),"heat, district or industrial, other than natural gas",MJ,"DocumentationGeneral comment This dataset represents the production of heat and certified electricity with wood chips in a state-of-the-art (as of 2014) co-generation plant with a capacity of 6667 kW (referring to fuel input) in Switzerland and was used as approximation for this dataset valid for a global average (uncertainties adjusted accordingly). The technology corresponds to a modern unit to be installed in 2014 in Switzerland, which is equipped with an electrostatic precipitator for particulate matter (PM) emission reduction and an SNCR device for reduction of NOx emissions. It is assumed that the plant is operated mainly producing heat, i.e. following the heat demand. Heat is therefore considered as the main product and therefore the reference product, whereas electricity is a by-product. Electricity is produced with an organic rankine cycle (ORC) steam generator.
Wood chips are burned in a boiler at a temperature of 800-1300 °C under excess air conditions and turned into carbon dioxide and water. Energy is set free in form of heat. Burning takes place with the following steps:

Drying

degradation of the wood into carbon and gases

degradation of the carbon into gases

oxidation of the gases

These phases overlap. The produced heat can be used directly or for steam production in order to generate electricity with a turbine.
Emissions vary with quality of the combustion (temperatur, mixing of the combustion gases and the added fresh air, retention time of gases in the combustor), filter technologies and with the efficiency of the plant. Emission data in this dataset are taken from measurements and literature as well as from communication with experts.
CO2 emissions were calculated out of the carbon content of the wood used as combustible. Carbon emitted in carbon monoxide was subtracted from the result.
Key emissions factors for CO, NOx, CH4, NMVOC and particles were updated according to latest data.
All other emission factors (per MJ fuel input) correspond to the 1000 kW boiler fuelled with wood chips from forest. Other exchanges correspond to the LCI data for the 6400 kW co-generation unit in ecoinvent v2.2.

[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]Technology The described plant Gösgen started commercial operation at the end of 1979.
